I am Bruce Kochumol Varghese. A software developer, and alter ego of Bino.

I’m a software developer with over a decade of experience crafting thoughtful, user-centric applications across the web. Over the years, I’ve worked with a diverse stack of technologies — from front-end frameworks like React and Angular, to back-end environments like Express.js, and databases powered by SQL. I thrive on building clean, scalable solutions that don’t just work — they feel right.

But coding is only half the story.

I’m deeply passionate about design and creativity. Whether it’s fine-tuning the UI down to the pixel or reimagining how users experience the web, I love shaping things that are not only functional but visually expressive. You could say I live at the intersection of logic and art.  

#### 💻 My Toolbox
- Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Express.js, SQL
- Favorite Editor: Visual Studio (because comfort matters)
- Browser of Choice: Firefox — clean, fast, developer-friendly
- Favorite Device: My trusty MacBook — where most of the magic happens

## Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

#### 🌿 Beyond the Code

When I’m not buried in lines of code or sketching wireframes, you’ll find me nurturing my ever-growing collection of plants 🌱. I find that taking care of them keeps me grounded — quite literally.

I’m also a big believer in stepping away from the screen:  
- 🎸 Playing guitar to unplug and get lost in melody
- 📚 Reading a mix of fiction, design, and tech books — always learning, always curious
- ✈️ Traveling to explore new cultures, landscapes, and ways of thinking

Every new place I visit, every story I read, and every tune I play adds a layer to how I approach both life and software.
